To execute the RCIM algorithm, use the tcsh script provided in script.txt, after replacing the relevant placeholders in the angled brackets (as explained in the script file itself). 
prerequisites: java 8 and python 3.5 or higher; Installing Gurobi (LP solver) from gurobi.com (free academic license). 

We have provided java programs, RLT and ELT, for generating RR sets, and for estinating the influence of a given seed set, resp. These should be replaced with adaptations of an exsiting RIS-based state-of-the-art standard IM algorithm, such as IMM, for improved performance.

We also provide several input networks in the format suiting our java programs.
