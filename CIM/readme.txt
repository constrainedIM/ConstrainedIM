To run the CIM algorithm one should change the parameters in the CIM.py file

Note: if you are running this on a 64-bit machine you will need to recomplie the imm files.
Source code is found at IMM, IMM_2 and IMM_Balanced. In each directory run make and copy the compiled file (imm_discrete/ protected_imm_discrete/ inf_imm_discrete) to the IMM_files directory.
